Information about the Nessus scan.

Plugin output:
Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Hoguin discovered that bitmap format images with a negative height could potentially result in memory corruption. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-3966)
