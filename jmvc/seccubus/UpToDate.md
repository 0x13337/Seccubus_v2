UpToDate MVC deals withthe UpToData api.

Goal
====
The goal of the UpToData api is to give the user a view to see if his 
applicaiton is the latest version

Story
-----
As a user I would like to know if I am using the latest version of the Seccubus
application. If a newer version is available I would like to be pointed to a 
download link
